# LunchNearBy
Simple application for searching nearby restaurants using Google Places API and written in Kotlin

## IMPORTANT ##
Project's "gradle.properties" file isn't under version control, because it should provide Google Places API key.
To be able to build and use application, please copy "example.gradle.properties" file and paste it with name "gradle.properties".
In your "gradle.properties" file put your Places API key value to "PLACES_API_KEY" property and after that you could move on.
